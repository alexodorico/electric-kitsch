# Electric Kitsch Website

### About
In early 2017 I approached Electric Kitsch to do a redesign of their website (they were using a default Wordpress theme). I wanted to make something that accurately represented their business and was easier to use from a content management perspective. I did some research on CMS and decided to build with Kirby. After the site was finished, they had some kind of issues with their domain name and unfortunately the site never went live. Site can be seen [here](electric-kitsch.firebaseapp.com).

### What I Learned
* A lot about CMS. I had never used one before, let alone developed with one
* A little bit of PHP

### Looking Back
* The SVG transitions in the "Contact" section don't scale correctly
* Not a fan of the bright orange background
* Wouldn't have used Kirby
